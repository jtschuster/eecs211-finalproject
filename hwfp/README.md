# [FINAL TODO: GAME TITLE]

## Instructions

1. For the path of the file that binarySearch() function in model.cpp takes in
must be changed to the path that refers to the model.txt file on your computer.
As we cannot submit the folder as a whole on GSC. Alternatively we will email you a
.zip folder that should work without any changes.

2. The game can be played by running and building the words.cpp file and the game
is played using the same guidelines as mentioned in the PROPOSAL.md

## Changes from proposal

1. We removed the function involving Success, failure, and victory noise as it was unnecessary
and we already had 14 other functional elements to implement.

## Evaluation guide

  1. Scores a word (with bonuses) - Implemented in test case
